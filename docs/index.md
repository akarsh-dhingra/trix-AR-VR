# TRIX AR/VR Interactive System

Welcome to the official website for the TRIX AR/VR project.

## Introduction

This site serves as the central hub for documenting our journey in developing a cutting-edge hybrid marker-based AR pizza visualization system. Here, we will share our learnings, publish progress updates, and post insightful blogs as we decode the process of building an immersive AR/VR experience.

## What to Expect

- **Project Documentation:** Detailed technical guides, architecture overviews, and implementation notes.
- **Learning Resources:** Insights gained, best practices, and lessons learned throughout the development process.
- **Progress Updates:** Regular updates on milestones, features, and improvements.
- **Blogs:** In-depth articles exploring challenges, solutions, and narratives from our development journey.
- **Scalability & Adoption:** Strategies and narratives on scaling the system for adoption by pizza chains worldwide.

## Project Overview

Our project focuses on building a hybrid AR system leveraging:

- QR code-based content retrieval
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for surface detection
- 3D object rendering for interactive pizza visualization

## Our Mission

We aim to create an engaging, scalable AR solution that can transform the way pizza chains interact with their customers globally. Along the way, we will document challenges, share our solutions, and provide a transparent narrative of our progress.

Stay tuned as we explore, innovate, and bring the future of AR/VR to the world of pizza!
