- **Project Overview:**  
    The Marker-Based Augmented Reality (AR) Interactive Menu System enhances the in-restaurant dining experience, initially focusing on pizza chains.

- **Current Challenges:**  
    - Traditional menus rely on static images and text.
    - Customers face uncertainty about:
        - Portion sizes
        - Ingredient composition
        - Allergen presence
        - Nutritional value
    - Pizza menus often involve many variations and customizations, making choices harder.

- **Solution Highlights:**  
    - Introduces an immersive, lightweight AR approach.
    - Integrates with existing printed menus using marker-based tracking.
    - Transforms physical menus into interactive visualization platforms.
    - No need to replace current menu formats.

- **Scalability:**  
    - While starting with pizza chains, the system is designed to expand.
    - Can support other food categories (e.g., burgers, desserts, beverages).
    - Adaptable for diverse restaurant formats.

- **Key Benefits:**  
    - Improves customer decision-making at the point of ordering.
    - Offers interactive visualization for better engagement.
