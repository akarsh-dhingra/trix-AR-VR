## Project Overview

The **AR/VR Interactive Marker-Based AR Menu Browsing System** is an augmented reality application designed to explore how physical restaurant menus can be enhanced through immersive, interactive digital content.  

The project investigates the use of **marker-based AR** as a practical, accessible, and low-cost approach for visualizing food items in three dimensions while maintaining a clear link between the physical and digital environments.

The primary objective of the system is to move beyond static images traditionally used in menus and instead offer users an interactive, spatially anchored browsing experience.

By scanning a physical marker — such as a printed menu card or QR-style image — users gain access to a virtual menu where food items can be explored visually, contextually, and interactively.

The project emphasizes:

- Usability  
- System stability  
- Meaningful interaction  

This makes it suitable for real-world deployment as well as academic demonstration.

## System Motivation and Design Philosophy

Early iterations of the project revealed a common limitation in basic AR applications:

- Frequent re-scanning  
- Fragmented scenes  
- Interactions focused more on novelty than usability  

Based on evaluative feedback, the system was refined to adopt a more structured and intentional interaction model.

The revised design prioritizes three core principles:

### 1️⃣ Scene Persistence  
Once activated, the AR environment should remain stable and continuous.

### 2️⃣ Minimal Physical Effort  
Users should not be required to repeatedly scan markers.

### 3️⃣ Meaningful Interaction  
Every interaction should serve a functional or informational purpose.

These principles directly informed the architectural decisions made in the refined system.

## Marker-Based Architecture and Scene Initialization

At the foundation of the system lies a **single-marker architecture**.

Instead of assigning individual markers to each menu item, the application intentionally uses **one physical marker** to represent the entire menu.  

This marker acts as a stable spatial anchor, defining the coordinate system in which all virtual content is rendered.

When the marker is detected by the device camera:

- The application initializes a single AR scene  
- The scene loads once  
- The interaction session continues without reinitialization  

This design:

- Minimizes tracking loss  
- Reduces user friction  
- Preserves immersion  

Upon successful detection, a default **3D pizza model** is rendered and anchored directly to the marker, establishing a clear connection between the physical menu and its digital counterpart.

## Persistent Scene Navigation and Model Management

A defining feature of the refined system is its **persistent AR scene**.

After the initial scan:

- The user does not need to interact with the marker again  
- Navigation is handled entirely through on-screen UI controls  

Pizza variations are explored using **left and right arrow buttons**.

Each button press dynamically replaces the currently displayed pizza model with another variant.

Importantly:

- Position remains constant  
- Orientation remains constant  
- Scale remains constant  

Only the model changes.

This ensures:

- Spatial consistency  
- No disorientation  
- Effective runtime asset swapping  
- Proper AR state management  

This demonstrates how interactive AR systems can dynamically update content without resetting spatial anchors.

## Ingredient-Level Interaction and Information Discovery

To extend the experience beyond simple visualization, the system incorporates **ingredient-level interaction**.

Individual toppings on the pizza model are clickable interactive elements.

When selected:

- The topping name appears  
- A brief descriptive overlay is displayed  

This transforms the AR menu into an exploratory interface and demonstrates object-level interaction within a marker-based AR scene.

## Nutritional Information and UI Integration

The system also includes a **nutrition toggle feature**.

Users can display or hide:

- Calorie values  
- Dietary classification (e.g., vegetarian / non-vegetarian)  

This information is accessed through a dedicated UI button.

The toggle-based design ensures:

- The AR scene remains visually clean  
- Information is available on demand  
- Users control their level of detail  

This reflects strong UI design principles within immersive environments.

## Project Outcome and Technical Significance

Through its refinements, the project evolves from a basic AR visualization into a structured interactive system.

The final implementation demonstrates:

- A strong understanding of marker-based AR principles  
- Effective UI and AR scene integration  
- Practical state and content management  
- A user-centered immersive interaction model  

The **Interactive Marker-Based AR Menu Browsing System** showcases how augmented reality can be applied in a practical, intuitive, and technically sound manner.

Rather than functioning as a visual gimmick, the system presents AR as a meaningful interface capable of enhancing everyday experiences such as menu browsing through thoughtful interaction design.
