## Background Context

When we first proposed building an augmented reality–based menu system, the idea felt exciting and practical. The core concept was simple: scan a menu, display a 3D pizza in AR, and enhance the ordering experience. It seemed modern, interactive, and relevant to real-world use.

However, during our initial presentation, we realized that having a good idea is not the same as having a well-defined system. While the motivation behind the project was understood, several important structural questions were raised. These questions helped us recognize that we had explained *what* we wanted to build, but not clearly enough *how* it would function.

## Discussion and Key Questions Raised

During the discussion, one of the main concerns was about marker usage.

It was unclear whether:
- A single marker would represent the entire menu, or  
- Multiple markers would be used for different items  

This created ambiguity about how the system would scale and function in practice.

Another important question was:
> “After scanning the marker, what exactly opens?”

We had not clearly defined:
- Whether a new scene would load  
- How navigation between items would work  
- Whether rescanning would be required for each item  

These questions revealed that our explanation lacked system-level clarity.

## Realizations from the Feedback

The biggest realization from Day 1 was that a project must be explained as a **complete interaction flow**, not just a list of features.

We understood that evaluators are assessing:
- Clarity of system behavior  
- Correct identification of AR type  
- Logical scene structure  
- Realistic scope and implementation  

Without defining marker behavior and scene persistence, the project risked appearing like a basic “scan-and-show” AR demo, even if additional features were planned.

## Structural Decisions Taken

Based on the feedback, we refined the structure of the project before moving forward.

The following decisions were made:

- The system will use **a single marker** (menu card or QR image).
- Scanning the marker will open **one persistent AR scene**.
- All interactions will occur within that same scene.
- Navigation between pizzas will happen using left and right arrows.
- Ingredient details and nutrition toggles will function inside the same AR environment.

By defining this clearly, the project shifted from a conceptual AR idea to a structured interactive system.

## Key Learning from Day 1

Day 1 taught us that clarity is more important than complexity. Even a technically simple AR system can be strong if the interaction flow is clearly defined and logically structured.

The most important takeaway was:
> Before building features, define the structure.

This reflection helped us move from idea-stage thinking to system-level planning.
